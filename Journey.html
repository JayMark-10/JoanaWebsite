                <p>Our journey hasn't always been easy, but we've made it through together. I just really appreciate how
                    long we've been together.</p>

                    <p>When we first met, we visited our classmate who had already passed away. I don’t know if that
                        moment really fit, because while visiting someone dead, I ended up being dead in love with you —
                        you were just so beautiful.</p>

                    <h3 style="font-size:20px">First Date</h3>
                    <p>We can’t really remember our official first date because we were always with someone so she could
                        go out since she wasn’t allowed to go out yet — she was still a “nene” back then. Now she’s a
                        big girl. But from what we do remember, our first date was at Jollibee.</p>

                    <p>This is my favorite trip because it’s recent and it’s the one I’ve been wanting for a long time —
                        our river trip. I also love it because we got so many nice pictures, unlike our previous
                        outings.</p>
